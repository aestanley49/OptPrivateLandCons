\section{Getting Started with optimization}

Metaheuristics (Heuristics for short) are used to create an optimized search of a solution space which likely has multiple local minima/maxima (or *multimodal*). While heuristics don't guarantee that you will find an optimal solution, they can be applied to many problems. 

Multimodal example: ![](OutsideImages/MultiModalOptFig.png)

There are three main components of heuristic algorithms and the design of these can have a major impact on how efficient the algorithm is: 

1.  Initial solution – Usually the closer the initial guess is to the optimal solution, the faster the algorithm will reach the best solution
2.  Neighborhood size – The advantage of a large neighborhood is that you are more likely to find a better next value for your solution than with a small neighborhood and less likely to get caught in a local minimum. The disadvantage is that you may have to value the cost (y -axis) many times and this may be computationally demanding
3.  Improvement algorithm – The nature of the improvement algorithm determines the type of heuristic algorithm being used. (this is also called the fitness function but more on that later) 

The other important difference in heuristics is deterministic vs stochastic. If a heuristic is deterministic, when you repeat the algorithm with the same values, you will always get the same solution. But stochastic heuristics include a random element either in the improve algorithm or in the neighborhood generation (which makes it more likely to converge). 


\section{What are Genetic Algorithms}

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a type of heuristic optimization methods based on Charles Darwin's ideas on natural selection where only the fittest individuals survive and reproduce over generations. GAs work by combining different solutions (or individuals) for a specified number of generations and extracting the best genes from each iteration. 

The basic structure of a GA is as follows: 
1.  Randomly generate an initial population 
2.  Create a fitness function which is used to determine the best solution 
3.  In each sequential population, generate children from two members of the previous population by applying __crossover__ and __mutation__ (more on this below)
4.  The population of children becomes a population of parents and we return to step 2 (unless a stopping criteria has been satisfied) to identify the fitness of each child

The solutions are the fittest individuals or chromosome

Two of these components are common across all heuristics (the initialization is the same as the initial population and the fitness assessment is the same as as the improvement algorithm). The three new components specific to GAs are selection, crossover and mutation. 

- Selection: 
    - Choose the fittest individuals and let them pass their genes to the next generation
    - This is based off an individual's fitness score so a higher fitness means that there is a higher chance of being selected to reproduce

- Cross-over
    - For each pair of partnes to be mated, a cross ofer point is chosen at random from within the genes
    - Offspring agre crated by exchanging the genes of parents amount themselves until the crossover point is reached

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A1: `0 0 0 | 0 0 0`    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A2: `1 1 1 | 1 1 1 `    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     `|` *= cross-over point* <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A3: `1 1 1 | 0 0 0`    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A4: `0 0 0 | 1 1 1 `   <br>
<br>

- Mutation 
    - When some offspring form, some of their genes can be subjected to a mutation (this happens with a low random probability). The result is that parts of the string can be flipped  <br>
    For example - A3: `1 1 0 1 1 0`    <br>
    - This occurs to prevent premature convergence 

Lets take a look at an example to show how this works..

\section{A basic example}

### Genetic Algorithm example: Herpotology 101

Let's say we are a local land trust that is trying to select which land parcels to buy. We really want all three herp species that we are interested in to be represented on the parcels we buy. Based on monitoring data, we have the following herps represented as present (= 1) or absent (= NA) on three different parcels of land.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data = data.frame(Landscape = c("patchA", "patchB", "patchC"),
                  Newt = c(1,NA,NA),
                  Salamander = c(1,1,NA),
                  Skink = c(NA,NA,1))

kable(data, 
      caption = "Table 1. Find the smallest number of sites that represents all species",
      align = "cccr", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px", extra_css = "border-style: none;")

```
In this case the optimum or best option would be to purchase patches **A** and **C**. So let's go ahead and work through this problem in a genetic algorithm. 

So how do we do this? Well first let's identify what the possible solutions are (these are the chromosomes that the GA can pick from). There are **7** different possible chromosomes: 

- (1,1,1) = (Patch A, Patch B, Patch C)
- (1,1,0) = (Patch A, Patch B)
- (1,0,1) = (Patch A, Patch C)
- (0,1,1) = (Patch B, Patch C)
- (1,0,0) = (Patch A only)
- (0,1,0) = (Patch B only)
- (0,0,1) = (Patch C only) 

<br>

!!!!! Not sure the first sentence here is correct - check with clint... !!!!!

In more complicated problems with bigger datasets, we won't be able to come up with all the different solutions that the GA could identify. Instead, we will supply a fitness function to the GA so that it can work through different solutions and pick the best one. Let's go ahead and define our fitness function here and then see how it works. 

For this problem, we want the smallest number of patches that maximizes the number of herp species. So the simplest version of our fitness function would be to find how many patches are in a given solution and then count how many herps we have in that solution. In code that would be: 
```{r}
fitFunc <- function(x) {
  current_n_patches = sum(x, na.rm = T) # No. patches in solution (x out of 3)
  chromosome_data = data[as.logical(x),]
  current_n_herps = sum(as.logical(colSums(chromosome_data, na.rm = T))) # How many herps do we have (x out of 3)
}
```
<br>
But this doesn't insure that we get all three herps so we are going to add a constraint. Now in addition to maximizing the number of herps in a solution, we are going to penalize the algorithm if it doesn't give us all 3 herp species. So we stick with counting the number of patches and herps are in a given solution, but we also tell the GA that if we don't have all 3 herps, then we are going to set that solution to 0. This means that the GA will recognize it has low fitness (is a bad solution) and won't select it. 
```{r}
fitFunc <- function(x) {
  ### Maximize number of herps
  current_n_patches = sum(x, na.rm = T) # No. patches in solution (x out of 3)
  chromosome_data = data[as.logical(x), c(-1)]
  current_n_herps = sum(as.logical(colSums(chromosome_data, na.rm = T))) # How many herps do we have (x out of 3)
  
  ### If we don't have all 3 species, penalize! 
  current_n_patches <- if_else(current_n_herps < 3, -1000, (-1 * current_n_patches))
  return(current_n_patches)
}
```
<br>

Let's go through and test this fitness function with a couple of chromosomes/potential solutions... First we will look at Patch A & Patch B and then we will look at Patch A & Patch C. We already know that Patch A & Patch C is the best solution as well as the only solution that contains all 3 herps. So let's see what happens...

- (1,1,0) = (Patch A, Patch B)
- (1,0,1) = (Patch A, Patch C)
<br>
```{r}
## Set up solutions
badsol <- c(1,1,0) #(Patch A, Patch B)
goodsol <- c(1,0,1) #(Patch A, Patch C)

## Run possible solutions through the fitness function
fitFunc(badsol)
fitFunc(goodsol)

```



```{r}

GA=ga(type='binary',
      fitness=fitFunc,
      nBits=nrow(data),
      maxiter=30,
      popSize=50,
      seed=100,
      keepBest=TRUE)

plot(GA)

summary(GA)
```



Note that we are running a chromosome that indicates wether a solution is in or out through the fitness function. And great we can see the fitness function is working! The number returned by the fitness function is the number of patches selected by the algorithm. We specified in the fitness function that if our criteria wasn't met that we shouldn't select any patches and that is why we are seeing a 0 returned. For our "good solution" we get 2 because there are two patches in that solution. Now let's go ahead and create a bigger dataset to run the genetic algorithm on. (If we run the genetic algorithm on this current dataset, it will be too small and struggle to converge... GAs weren't created to find the solution of really simple problems like this one but if we expand the problem then it will get interesting!).

!!!! Again this last part might be a problem... !!!!! 

So I've created a dataframe that has 75 different patches and 9 different herpetology species inside it. Again, each patch as a random number of species in it and we want to find the smallest number of patches that will cover all 9 species. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

set.seed(1234)

mat <- matrix(NA, nrow = 75, ncol = 2) #create an empty matrix with 75 patches and then 9 species
# converting matrix to data frame
data_frame <- data.frame(mat)

data_frame$X1 <- "patch"
data_frame$X2 <- c(1:75)
data_frame$patchID <- str_c(data_frame$X1, "_", data_frame$X2)

ncol<- 9 #(number of different actions: Do nothing, graze, timber management, burn)
nrow <- 75
mat01 <- matrix(rbinom(nrow*ncol,1,.25),nrow,ncol)
  
Herps <- cbind(data_frame$patchID, mat01)
colnames(Herps) <- c("patchID", "species1", "species2", "species3", "species4", "species5", "species6", "species7", "species8", "species9")
Herps <- as.data.frame(Herps)
Herps[,c(2:10)] <- sapply(Herps[ ,c(2:10)], as.numeric)

data <- Herps


kable(head(Herps), 
      align = "cccccccccc", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px", extra_css = "border-style: none;")

```


For the new dataframe, we have to adjust the fitness function so that we penalize it if we don't have all 9 species. 
We also need to account for the fact that we want to minimize the number of patches. Genetic Algorithms are algorithms designed to search for the global maximum but we want to find the local minimum. This is a simple enough fix - we just multiple the number of patches being returned by -1 so the more patches that are returned, the lower the fitness of that solution because the solution will have a bigger negative). We also change the penalty function, whereas before we had it set to 0 now we want to set it to 1000 so that if that combination of patches is selected then we will get a pretty big number x -1 which the GA won't want to select. 
```{r}
fitFunc <- function(x) {
  ### Maximize number of herps
  current_n_patches = sum(x, na.rm = T) # No. patches in solution (x out of 75)
  chromosome_data = data[as.logical(x), c(-1)]
  current_n_herps = sum(as.logical(colSums(chromosome_data, na.rm = T))) # How many herps do we have (x out of 9)
  
  ### If we don't have all 9 species, penalize! 
  current_n_patches <- if_else(current_n_herps < 9, 1000, current_n_patches)
  return(-1 * current_n_patches)
}

```

So now we are all set to put this through the GA. We'll use the Genetic Algorithm package writen by Luca Scrucca. The vignette can be found [here](http://127.0.0.1:45056/help/library/GA/doc/index.html). There are a couple of important parameters to set inside this package: 
```{r}
GA=ga(type='binary', ## For this problem, parcels are either in or out of the solution so we set type to binary
      fitness= fitFunc, ## This is just defining the fitness funciton that we created earlier 
      nBits=nrow(data), ##  
      maxiter=300, ## Maximum number of times to run the GA before it stops 
      popSize=30, ## this is the number of chromosomes that will be generated
      keepBest=TRUE) ## Normally we discard the old population so if you find a solution that is very good, then it's lost. But we can modify this by picking the elite of a current generation

summary(GA)

```
In addition to telling us what parameters were used in the actal model, the `summary` also tells us the results from this model. The fitness value of -3 is the smallest number of parcels that are needed to cover all 9 species . So only 3 parcels are needed. (Our fitness function was multiplying the number of patches returned by -1 which is why the value is returned as negative). We can see which patches were selected in binary form (present or absent in the solution) but this isn't very helpful so let's pull that information into a table. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

df_sol <- data[GA@solution[1, ] == 1, ]

ga_best_solution = GA@solution 

Sol_Herps <- data
Sol_Herps$Site_Richness <- rowSums(Sol_Herps[,c(2:10)])
Sol_Herps[,c(12:13)] <- t(ga_best_solution)

Sol1 <- Sol_Herps[which(Sol_Herps$V12 == 1),] 
Sol2 <- Sol_Herps[which(Sol_Herps$V13 == 1),] 
#Sol3 <- Sol_Herps[which(Sol_Herps$V14 == 1),] 
#Sol4 <- Sol_Herps[which(Sol_Herps$V15 == 1),] 

Solutions <- as.data.frame(cbind(Sol1[,1], Sol2[,1]))
names(Solutions) <- c("Solution 1","Solution 2")

kable(Solutions, 
      align = "cc", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px", extra_css = "border-style: none;")

```

Now it's clear that the 3 patches were selected for both solutions but one solution chose patch 18 while the other chose patch 28. 

We can also generate a plot of what the GA does over generations. It's pretty important that we see the algorithm plauto and find a solution. If the graph is still growing, then odds are good that the GA hasn't converged on the optimum solution yet and you need to increase the number of generations `maxiters`
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(GA)
```

If you go through and run the code here, it's possible that you will get a different set of soltions because this is a simulated example with stochasticity so the data you generate will be slightly different, as will the results of the GA.

Also, the problem we presented here is also known as the minimum set problem where the goal is to minimize the cost of the reserve system while ensuring that all constraints are met. This is the same problem that marxan <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.9CwGYuYjHds3YijYSPz3xwAAAA&pid=Api" width="50" height="50" /> solves using Simulated Annealing (which we will talk about later) and spacally explicit data. 


### Genetic Algorithm example 2: Habitat Acquisition for Bobwhites

Let's put the minimum set problem in a more complicated real world context. Unfortatnely that means that we will have to switch from talking about herps to talking about birds.. ah well. 

So in this new problem, you are still trying to pick different patches of habitat this time for a single species (a bird called the northern bobwhite). Now we want to add some additional elements of realism to this example. For starters, parcels can be different sizes, hold different population sizes and we can apply different actions to the the landscape to change habitat which will have (hopefully) have a (positive) effect on the population. 

Let's go ahead and simulate this landscape: 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## Specify dimensions of landscape 
m = matrix(0, 100, 100)

## set number of patches
n.patch <- 100
## Put that landscape into a raster 
r = raster(m, xmn=0, xmx=100, ymn=0, ymx=100)
## First random value generated for size
k1 <- rtruncnorm(n=1, a=0.1, b=60, mean=10, sd=25.09)
# create first patch then add to landscape
rr = makePatch(r, size = k1, val=1, rast=TRUE) # create first patch then add to landscape

## Loop over landscape to create patches 
for (i in 1:n.patch){
  k1 <- rtruncnorm(n=1, a=0.1, b=60, mean=10, sd=25.09) # Generate a random value for patch size with a min of .1 and max of 60
  ID <- c(i + 1) # To create the ID, add 1 for each run 
  rr = makePatch(rr, size = k1, val=ID, rast=TRUE) 
}

plot(rr)

rrr <- as.data.frame(rr)
```

The landscape that we generate has 100 different patches on it of all different sizes. To make sure we know which patch is which, we have assigned an ID to each on which is what the scale bar on the right hand side of the graph is indicating (it goes up to 100 because we created 100 different patches). We can get the size of each patch by counting the number of cells each patch is on. So now we have the size of each patch and a unique ID. We can then randomly assign an action to each parcel. Our options include: 

- Do nothing 
- Graze
- Timber Management  
- Burn 

Which looks like this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}

r2d2 <- rrr %>%   group_by(layer) %>% add_count(layer) %>%  #Create new column of size of each patch called "n" 
  pivot_wider(names_from = layer, values_from = n, values_fn = length) #creating new column where colnames are ID for each patch


r2d2 <- as.data.frame(t(r2d2)) #want to switch patches to be rows  

## building dataframe with only 1 action assigned per patch   
r2d2$ran=sample(4,nrow(r2d2),T)
Patch_Actions <- rownames_to_column(r2d2, "Patch_ID")
Patch_Actions <- Patch_Actions %>%  
  mutate(Action_Zzz = case_when(ran == 1 ~ 1, ran != 1 ~ 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Action_Graze = case_when(ran == 2 ~ 1, ran != 2 ~ 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Action_timMang = case_when(ran == 3 ~ 1, ran != 3 ~ 0)) %>% 
  mutate(Action_Burn = case_when(ran == 4 ~ 1, ran != 4 ~ 0)) 
Patch_Actions$ran <- NULL ## remove column with randomly assigned numbers 
colnames(Patch_Actions) <- c("Patch_ID", "Size"  ,     "Action_Zzz"     ,   "Action_Graze"  ,      "Action_timMang"   ,     "Action_Burn"  )

Patch_Actions <- Patch_Actions[-c(1),] #we want to remove the first row because that one holds all the cells that weren't selected to be placed in a patch

head(Patch_Actions)
```


Now we need to take into account the species' (birds') response. To start with, we can randomly generate bird abundance per patch. We also need to create 3 functions for our actions will impact the bird response (we are making the assumption that the "do nothing" action won't change the population that we started with so no function for that action). 

!!! MORE on functions - is there a way to plot these or at least write out mathematical formulas???

1) Let's assume that there is a linear relationship between timber management and bird response
$$
y = \beta_o + .4 x
$$
Where
$y$ is the bird response, $\beta_o$ is the intercept or the number of birds that we start with on a patch and $\beta_1$ is the proportional increase which is .4 in this case. 

2) Bruning

3) Grazing 
First part of this - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation

$g(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}A_i*\chi\alpha_i$ 

\begin{equation}
\chi\alpha_i=\begin{cases}
          0 \quad &\text{if} \, x \in \mathbb{\alpha} \\
          .5 \quad &\text{if} \, x \notin \mathbb{\alpha} \\
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}



```{r, echo=FALSE}
#### Need to add bird response 

set.seed(1234)

## randomly generate bird abundance per patch 
  for(i in 1:nrow(Patch_Actions)){ #iterate across the rows of mat
    Patch_Actions[i,7] <- ceiling(rtruncnorm(n=1, a=0.1, b=30, mean=15, sd=10.09)) # Generate a random value for bird abundance and round to nearest whole number 
  }


#### Now need functions for how actions impact bird abundance 

## try proportional relationship between timber mang. and bird (as 1 goes up so does the other)
  # m = .4, x = no cells treated (start with 1) and y = no birds generated (start with current value then add)
Action_Bird_Mod_timMang <- function(Patch_Actions){ ## note this function just creates a new column... 
  # select ONLY the patches that have timbermanagement actions and do linear calculation
  Patch_Actions %>% mutate(TimM_bird_count = case_when(Action_timMang == 1 ~ Patch_Actions$Size * .4 + Patch_Actions$V7, Action_timMang != 1 ~ 0 )) # otherwise place a 0 
 ##  y = m*x + b0
  # For each of these patches... apply 
  #b0[i] <- subsetpatchactions[i,7] #intercept is starting no birds
 # m <- .4 # set proportional amount 
  #x[i] = subsetpatchactions[i,2] #x is patch size 
 # y[i] = m*x[i] + b0[i]
}


## 75% of time burning is benefital for birds and 25% it's not 
  # chose random number of cells within a patch to burn 
  # flip loaded coin to see whether outcome is good or bad 
  # depending on outcome, either add X birds from patch or subtract Y 
## biased coinflip
Action_Bird_Mod_Burn <- function(Fillme){
  x <- rbinom(n = Fillme, size = 1, prob = .65) ## flip a biased coin (can use this as a switch) # n = number of times flip coin 
  birds <- 2 # number of birds we get for burning a single cell  (* number of cells in next line)
  ((x*birds*Fillme + Patch_Actions$V7*x)*Patch_Actions$Action_Burn) # note, for this function, don't get the number of birds started with back if have a bad burn
}

## Step-wise function for grazing? (where x = no acres, y = + bird abundance)
  # For every range of cells treated, bird abundance will increase by A 
Action_Bird_Mod_Graze <- function(x){
  k = 0 # starting value 
  b = 7 #length of step so for every 2 cells modified.... 
  a = .5 # level btw steps ... get additional .5 birds 
  # SO getting additonal .5 birds for every 2 cells modified
  y <- a*floor(x/b) + k 
   ## Will need to add number of additional birds generated to starting value
  (y + Patch_Actions$V7)*Patch_Actions$Action_Graze ##  Also need to add increase got from grazing action to the starting number of birds
}



### ### apply functions to adjust bird numbers across patches... 
# Timber management function
Patch_Actions <- Action_Bird_Mod_timMang(Patch_Actions)
# Burn function
Patch_Actions$burn_birds_count <- Action_Bird_Mod_Burn(Patch_Actions$Size) 
# Grazing function
Patch_Actions$grazing_birds_count  <- Action_Bird_Mod_Graze(Patch_Actions$Size) 


Patch_Actions <- Patch_Actions %>% mutate(Bird_Count_w_Actions = TimM_bird_count + burn_birds_count + grazing_birds_count + (V7*Action_Zzz))



Patch_Actions <- Patch_Actions %>% 
  mutate(act_cat = case_when(Action_Zzz == 1 ~ 4, 
                             Action_Graze == 1 ~ 3,
                             Action_timMang == 1 ~ 2,
                             Action_Burn == 1 ~ 1))

## So the columns we want to focus on in GA are.. 
Patch_Actions_Prep <- Patch_Actions %>% dplyr::select(Bird_Count_w_Actions, act_cat)


```

These functions are applied to the patches of habitat that have been assigned the specific action. (ie, a patch that is assigned a burn will have it's population modified by the burn function) So we are modifying the number of species found on the landscape. Now that we know the number of species we are working with, we can apply a GA to identify which patches to chose but first we need to create a fitness function for this problem. 

```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
## Setting up code for the fitness function
Gems <- Patch_Actions %>% dplyr::select(Patch_ID, Bird_Count_w_Actions, act_cat)

### Creating a random chromosome to check function with... 
Gems$ran=sample(8,nrow(Gems),T)
Gems[which(Gems$ran != 1),4] <- 0
```

In the previous fitness function, we multiplied the value that the optimization function was returning by -1 to coerce the GA to return the minimum number of patches instead of the maximum. Here, we are going to do something slightly different where instead of trying to find the minimum number of patches, we will impose a constraint. The constraint is that if the number of patches selected by the GA is greater than 34, then we will penalize that option by returning a 0 so that selection preforms really poorly. We can also add more than one penality/constraint. The second one I've added to this problem is trying to address the fact that the "burn" action returns a lot more birds than the other types of actions and I don't want all the actions to be burns. To adjust for that, I've assigned each of the actions numeric values and I am having the GA keep track of the value of actions so if the sum of all actions is too high (too many burns) then that combo also performs poorly. 
```{r}
fun_tryme <- function(x){
  value = x*Gems[,2]
  total_value_of_chromosome = sum(value)
  
  # Control the number of patches selected 
  No_patches <- 34
  no_patch_selected <- sum(x)
  total_value_of_chromosome <- if_else(no_patch_selected > No_patches, 0, total_value_of_chromosome)
  
  # controls value of actions (don't want all to be the same action )
  action = sum(x*Gems[,3])
  maxcount <- 15
  if(action < maxcount)
    return(0)
  else
    return(total_value_of_chromosome)
}
```

Let's go ahead and run the GA with a couple of tweaks to the parameters from the last time we ran it. The main changes, in addition to changing the fitness function, were to make the population larger (it's a larger problem), increase the number of times the GA runs before it stops and to provide an initial solution so the GA has somewhere to start - I include a random number of selected patches as a starting value to the GA because otherwise I found that it struggled to converge. Most of these parameters won't be perfect the first time you run a GA and will need some tunning (trial and error adjustments). 

```{r}
gann <- ga(type = "binary", ## For this problem, parcels are either in or out of the solution so we set type to binary
           fitness = fun_tryme, ## This is just defining the fitness funciton that we created earlier 
           popSize = 200, ## this is the number of chromosomes that will be generated
           maxiter = 1000, ## Maximum number of times to run the GA before it stops 
           run = 250, 
           suggestions = Gems$ran, ### providing initial solution so GA has somewhere to start - I include a random number of selected patches as a starting value to the GA because otherwise I found that it struggled to converge. 
           nBits = nrow(Gems), 
           seed = 1234) # this lets us replicate the results of the GA)

# We can add the selected parcels to our original dataset to see which ones were chosen 
df_sol <- Gems[gann@solution[1, ] == 1, ]

plot(gann)

summary(gann)


### ### Question for Clint - why don't the values differ with and without keepBest between these 2 GAs? 
## What happens when we add "keepBest?"
gann2 <- ga(type = "binary", ## For this problem, parcels are either in or out of the solution so we set type to binary
           fitness = fun_tryme, ## This is just defining the fitness funciton that we created earlier 
           popSize = 200, ## this is the number of chromosomes that will be generated
           maxiter = 1000, ## Maximum number of times to run the GA before it stops 
           run = 250, 
           suggestions = Gems$ran, ### providing initial solution so GA has somewhere to start
           nBits = nrow(Gems), 
           seed = 12345, # this lets us replicate the results of the GA
          keepBest=TRUE) ## Normally we discard the old population so if you find a solution that is very good, then it's lost. But we can modify this by picking the elite of a current generation

#plot(gann2)
#summary(gann2)
#df_sol2 <- Gems[gann2@solution[1, ] == 1, ]
```
We can see that it took 583 iterations before the GA stopped. While we set `maxiter` to 1000, the GA stopped before it reached this value because `run` was set to 250. So we reached the number of consecutive generations without any improvement before we reached the maximum number of iterations and so our GA stopped. Our fitness value was 1473.4 birds across 34 patches. So our first constraint was met - the GA didn't select more than 34 parcels. We can check our second constraint by taking the sum of the action categories of the patches selected in the solution. 
```{r}
sum(df_sol$act_cat)
```

And again we can see that this constraint was met - the value of our actions are greater than 15.


### Simulated Annealing example: Habitat Acquisition for Bobwhites

Using the same data and example from the previous example on bobwhites, we'll repeat the same problem but instead of solving it with a Genetic Algorithm, we can use a different type of heuristic optimization algorithm called Simulated Annealing (SA). SA functions in many of the same ways as a GA in that it focuses on searching a specified neighborhood from an initial starting point. The concept behind SA is based on annealing from metallgury where metal is headed up to a certain temperature and then controlled cooling is used to change it's properties. So the SA algorithm starts by "heating" the problem up to a specified temperature that has a corresponding probability value that indicates whether or not a given solution should be accepted. As the temperature drops, the cooling also lowers the probability of a value being selected until it stabilizes. This set up allows For the SA to explore the neighborhood and accept possibly bad solutions in the beginning before stabilizing on the best solution in much later iterations. Without the probability value, then the SA would just be a gradient search tool that would stop once it reached the local minimum.
